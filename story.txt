One day, little Johny decided he was going to be a professional baseball player. Him and his buddies all decided they would have to train really hard. So, they decided to build a training camp they could meet up at and
train every day of the week. Once they had completed this training camp, it was so well built, that other professional baseball teams wanted to use it. They agreed on one condition, and that was that hey would get to
practice with the big leagers. They were so happy.
